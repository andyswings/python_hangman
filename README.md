# python_hangman

Here is a challange for all of you coders out there.
Try to make a better version of hangman than me!

The rules are simple!
* download and run my .py file but try not to look at the code.
* try to make your own version before you look through mine.
* once you have yours done upload it so we all can see your master piece!
* if you get absolutely stuck, then and only then you can look through my source code, but you must note that you did.
* you should try to use python exclusively
* and last of all... HAVE FUN!

Full disclosure. I started this project by looking at a tutorial, and at some point decided that I could create a much better version, so yes I did initially look at someone else's code, but much of it has been changed.
